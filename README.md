# redstart

The goal of `redstart` is to simulate the dynamics of migratory songbirds throughout their entire annual migratory cycle using a model developed by Runge and Marra (2004) "[Modeling seasonal interactions in the population dynamics of migratory birds](https://avibirds.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/amerikaanse-roodstaart2.pdf)," from the monograph *[Birds of Two Worlds: The Ecology and Evolution of Migration](https://books.google.com/books/about/Birds_of_Two_Worlds.html?id=72Kp8vTzlhIC)*, edited by  Russell Greenberg and Peter Marra.

The package takes its name from the [American Redstart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_redstart), a common warbler in the forests of eastern North America and central Canada.
