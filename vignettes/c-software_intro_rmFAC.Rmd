The full-annual cycle (FAC) model of Runge and Marra (2004) is a density-dependent (dd) matrix model.  The principal output of a density-dependent model is the **equilibrium population size**.  An important issue with dd models is that you can typically only determine the equilibrium population size using numerical simulation.  This means that you actually have to plug information -- particularly initial population sizes -- into the model and run it through many iterations and monitor the output until you see that it converges to a stable state. This is in contrast to traditional matrix models and their cousin, integral projection model (IPMs), which can be analyzed mathematically without specifying a starting population state or iterating the model (Footnote: assuming they are ergodic; Stott et al 2010 Method E&E)
