\title{Equation 18: Build vector of reproduction/fecundity values (R.all)}
\usage{
eq18AbuildRvec(R.base.rate = 1.8, R.hab.effect = 0.5, co = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{R.base.rate}{Base rate of TODO wbhat}

\item{R.hab.effect}{Effect of breeding in poor habitat; in table 28.3 base fec is 1.8, while in poor habitat it is 0.9, so habitat effect is 0.5}

\item{co}{strength of carry over effect}
}
\value{
R.all All reproductive values (TODO check)
}
\description{
"average fecunidty for pairs in source and sink habitat" is a function of how the proportion of pairs in that habitat that are good-good, good-poor etc.  (Runge and Marra 2004, pg TOD())
}
\details{
By default these are fixed for the entire duration of the study.

Calculations are found in Table 28.3.
